I built my first npm module!

<br>

## What is the reason I build a module?

I spent some time to search node module that is easy to export HTML table to excel.

However, I could not find the best fit solution that fit my needs.

## Why I re-invent the wheel?

I find a lot node modules is too complex, I need something smaller and easier to use.

Hence, I built a it, a javascript tool to export HTML table / JSON to valid excel file effortlessly. 

Uses [exceljs](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) under the hood to create actual excel file.
